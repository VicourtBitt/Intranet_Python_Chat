# üí¨ Intranet Python Chat 
This project works with only two Python third-party modules:

- üì® [Paho.MQTT](https://eclipse.dev/paho/files/paho.mqtt.python/html/client.html) for communication protocol;
- üì™ [GetMac](https://pypi.org/project/getmac/) to gather the address.

Also, this project uses built-in modules:
- üóÇÔ∏è [JSON](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/v2.7.2/library/json.html) to storage the messages from the MQTT retained topic;
- ‚è∞ [DateTime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) to gather the specific time that the user sends the message or when the user registers;
- üßë‚Äçüíª [SYS](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) to leave the code when we are at some specific conditions;
- üóÑÔ∏è [AST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) to convert string list into lists with ast.literal_eval();

## ‚ùì Which Purpose Does This Project Have?
My project is all about creating an internal network chat system using Python, MQTT, and JSON. Python is the main language we're using to build the chat system, MQTT is how messages are sent and received securely, and JSON helps us store and organize data.
I'm focused on making sure this chat system is easy to use and safe for company communications. With our mix of technologies, we're aiming to create a chat system that's both user-friendly and secure, so everyone in the company can communicate efficiently and without worries about privacy.


## üîÑ Possible Future Updates
- DJango Framework (GUI); OR
- Flet (GUI).

I've created a Flet base program, but when the code reach the "display log" part, the Flet Aplication just crashes. I'll try to solve this error, probably this will take some time, but i'll manage to do reach a solution.


## üõ†Ô∏è This Code Works With
I've created a Module named "CleanTerminarModule", this module is a simple way to explain, just cleans the terminal depending in which OS the User are at the moment.
